We live in a world that’s drowning in data. Websites track every user’s every click. Your smartphone is building up a record of your location and speed every second of every day. “Quantified selfers” wear pedometers-on-steroids that are always recording their heart rates, movement habits, diet, and sleep patterns. Smart cars collect driving habits, smart homes collect living habits, and smart marketers collect purchasing habits. The internet itself represents a huge graph of knowledge that contains (among other things) an enormous cross-referenced encyclopedia; domain-specific databases about movies, music, sports results, pinball machines, memes, and cocktails; and too many government statistics (some of them nearly true!) from too many governments to wrap your head around. Buried in these data are answers to countless questions that no one’s ever thought to ask. In this book, we’ll learn how to find them.
